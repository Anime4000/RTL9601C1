# TP-Link Firmware Modifications

The majority of the firmware included in this section is enhanced with Debug Mode, a feature absent in standard firmware versions.

## Debug Page Access

The debug page is not readily accessible but can be reached by following these steps based on your router's LAN subnet:

- Navigate to `http://192.168.0.1/webpages/debug.html`

On the debug page, you have the ability to input commands that enable the 2.5G mode. It's important to note that this activation is temporary, and if the router is rebooted, the process will need to be repeated.

### Instructions for Debug Mode Activation

1. Access the debug page using the provided URL.
2. Input the relevant command to enable 2.5G mode.
3. Keep in mind that this activation is not persistent across reboots, necessitating a repeat of the process after each restart.

Please exercise caution when using debug features and refer to the user documentation for additional guidance on the commands and their implications.
