# 2.5Gb Compatibility
In this list, help you to find and build 2.5Gbps ONU for your 1Gbps+ Fiber Subscription, main goal is to reduce bufferbloat due to flooding 1GbE Port.

Also useful for 2.5Gbps Subscriber who to want to replace stock ONU

## 2.5Gb Mode
RTL960x has 3 different 2.5Gb Mode:
| Command | Medium | Info |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `LAN_SDS_MODE 4` | HiSGMII PHY | Ethernet Layer 1  |
| `LAN_SDS_MODE 5` | HiSGMII MAC | Ethernet Layer 2  |
| `LAN_SDS_MODE 6` | 2500Base-X  | Fiber Transceiver |

> ⚠️ V2801F and it's sister ignore `LAN_SDS_MODE` flash parameter, require to patch `runlansds.sh`
